# Pacman Clone

This project contains a very simple Pacman clone built with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/).

Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game. Use the arrow keys to move Pacman around the maze and eat the pellets. This is just the beginning of a clone and can be extended with ghosts, scoring and more levels.
